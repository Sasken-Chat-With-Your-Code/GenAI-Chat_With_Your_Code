# GenAI-Chat_With_Your_Code

### Local Model Approach
This version of Chat With Code runs entirely on your local machine using Qwen 1.5-0.5B-Chat model for understanding and answering questions about a C/C++ codebase. It leverages FastAPI for serving the backend, FAISS for efficient vector-based retrieval of code chunks, and implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to provide context-aware, accurate responses.
